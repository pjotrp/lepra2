## TODO

Important: LEPRA is under development. Your testing and commenting is critical
to development. Please test LEPRA by modifying records.  Note that changes to
the database will be discarded later.

For your consideration:

* The screens are still barren. This can be improved on over time
* The main thing to test is the database 'model'. I.e. how the data is organised
* We need to complete patient treatment card - pending your decision on what to do with old Lepra112 fields
* A lot of fields have new naming - please check whether it can be improved
* LEPRA will be used outside Bangladesh. Therefore we should be as generic in our approach as possiple
* Current issues are listed [here](https://github.com/pjotrp/lepra2/issues)

Enjoy.
